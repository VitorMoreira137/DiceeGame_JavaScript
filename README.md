Two-Player Dice Game Website

This is a simple and fun web-based dice game for two players.
Each player "rolls" a virtual die by refresing the browser, and the website randomly generates a number between 1 and 6 for each player. 
The result is displayed using dice images, and the website declares the winner based on who rolled the higher number.
In case of a tie, the game shows a draw message.
This project is a great introduction to basic web development, random number generation, and user interaction using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
